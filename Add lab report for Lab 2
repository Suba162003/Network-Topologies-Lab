# Lab 2: Implementation of Network Topologies

## Objective
To implement and understand different network topologies.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software

## Theory
### Overview of Various Network Topologies
1. **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line. Data travels in both directions along the line.
2. **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data passes through the hub before reaching its destination.
3. **Ring Topology**: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular data path.
4. **Mesh Topology**: Each device is connected to multiple other devices, allowing for multiple paths for data.
5. **Hybrid Topology**: A combination of two or more different topologies.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Launch the software and familiarize yourself with the interface.
2. **Implement a Bus Topology**:
   - Added three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3).
   - Connected devices in a linear fashion.
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.1.1
     - PC2: 192.168.1.2
     - PC3: 192.168.1.3
3. **Implement a Star Topology**:
   - Added a switch and connected three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3).
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.2.1
     - PC2: 192.168.2.2
     - PC3: 192.168.2.3
4. **Implement a Ring Topology**:
   - Arranged three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3) in a circular layout.
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.3.1
     - PC2: 192.168.3.2
     - PC3: 192.168.3.3
5. **Implement a Mesh Topology**:
   - Connected three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3) to each other.
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.4.1
     - PC2: 192.168.4.2
     - PC3: 192.168.4.3

## Observations
- All topologies were successfully implemented.
- Connectivity was tested using the ping command for each configuration.

## Conclusion
Different network topologies offer various advantages and disadvantages, affecting network performance and reliability. Understanding these topologies is essential for effective network design.
