# Lab 2: Implementation of Network Topologies

## Objective
To implement and understand different network topologies.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software

## Theory
### Overview of Various Network Topologies
1. **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line. Data travels in both directions along the line.
2. **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data passes through the hub before reaching its destination.
3. **Ring Topology**: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular data path.
4. **Mesh Topology**: Each device is connected to multiple other devices, allowing for multiple paths for data.
5. **Hybrid Topology**: A combination of two or more different topologies.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Launch the software and familiarize yourself with the interface.
2. **Implement a Bus Topology**:
   - Added three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3).
   - Connected devices in a linear fashion.

3. **Implement a Star Topology**:
   - Added a switch and connected three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3).
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.2.1
     - PC2: 192.168.2.2
     - PC3: 192.168.2.3
4. **Implement a Ring Topology**:
   - Arranged three devices (PC1, PC2, PC3) in a circular layout.
   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.3.1
     - PC2: 192.168.3.2
     - PC3: 192.168.3.3
5. **Implement a Mesh Topology**:

   - Configured IP addresses:
     - PC1: 192.168.4.1
     - PC2: 192.168.4.2
     - PC3: 192.168.4.3

## Conclusion
In this lab, we explored four different network topologies: bus, star, ring, and mesh. Each topology has distinct characteristics:

- **Bus Topology**: Simple and cost-effective for small networks; vulnerable to cable failures.
- **Star Topology**: Centralized architecture; easy to troubleshoot; dependent on the central device.
- **Ring Topology**: Circular data path; fast data transmission but vulnerable to single point failures.
- **Mesh Topology**: Highly redundant and reliable; complex and costly to implement.

Overall, the choice of topology depends on the specific requirements of the network, including cost, performance, and redundancy needs.
